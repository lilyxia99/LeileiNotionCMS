1-month workshop, Guangzhou, 4/2022-5/2022
In collaboration with Huangbian Station (Guangdong Times Museum), I initiated a 3-week, 7-session workshop that combines 3D blender
animation and a traditional Chinese sport called ‚ÄúPush Hands‚Äù, similar to Taichi. Inspired by Jacques Ranciere‚Äôs The Ignorant Schoolmaster, I was not focusing on teaching the 3D software techniques, but was trying to build a community that encourages self-learning, communication and sharing, and investigation of the mind-body connection. The process, instead of outcome, is highly emphasized in our practice. In the workshop, we do animation and push hands alternatively, and had a group sharing at the end of each session. Participants also collaborated on animation clips, as if pushing hands both in real life and in software.</p><img src="https://dzwpzdzxmxubgbpjkwlm.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/notion-images/push-hand/image-1755405886129.png" alt="The image shows a group of people gathered in a casual indoor setting, possibly a cafe or a community space. They are seated around tables with laptops, drinks, and other items. The walls have large windows, allowing natural light to flood the room. Some people are focused on their devices, while others appear engaged in conversation. The atmosphere is relaxed and bright, with a lot of natural greenery visible outside through the windows. The environment has a creative and collaborative feel." class="content-image" /></div><div class="column"><img src="https://dzwpzdzxmxubgbpjkwlm.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/notion-images/push-hand/image-1755405888145-1.png" alt="The image shows several pairs of people practicing martial arts or dance-like movements on a sidewalk. They are near a red car parked by the curb. The scene takes place in a quiet urban setting with closed shops in the background. Most participants are dressed casually, and the area is shaded by trees. The focus is on the synchronized movements and interactions between the pairs." class="content-image" /><img src="https://dzwpzdzxmxubgbpjkwlm.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/notion-images/push-hand/image-1755405890125-2.png" alt="The image shows three people sitting in a room with large windows, letting in natural light. The room has a few laptops on a table, one with animation software open showing a cartoon drawing. The walls are white, and there&amp;#39;s greenery visible outside the windows. One person wears a grey outfit, another in red with light-colored hair, and a third in a white shirt with short dark hair. The atmosphere appears casual and engaged." class="content-image" /><p>After the workshop, I collected participants' animations and their audio responses to the workshop and collaborated with another animator to make a short about the workshop itself. The short is both an independent film, a summary of people's works, a text for critical reflection, and guidance for other people to carry out a similar workshop.</p></div></div><div class="column-list"><div class="column"><img src="https://dzwpzdzxmxubgbpjkwlm.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/notion-images/push-hand/image-1755405899318-3.png" alt="The image is a colorful, abstract scene with rough digital brushstrokes. In the foreground, a purple figure with simple shapes is reaching out. A yellow railing separates this figure from another abstract character on the left, which has a teardrop shape and a stick-like body. In the background, there are tall, blue-gray skyscrapers and a red-roofed building with a sign. The scene is bright and has a variety of colors, with light blue and green hues dominating the background." class="content-image" /><img src="https://dzwpzdzxmxubgbpjkwlm.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/notion-images/push-hand/image-1755405902167-4.png" alt="The image features a yellow boat with a simple, abstract purple figure lounging inside. The figure seems relaxed, with legs resting up. The boat is on a calm body of water, with a lifesaver attached to the boat&amp;#39;s side. In the background, there&amp;#39;s a wooden bridge arching over the water, and some greenery is visible along the banks. The sky is clear and blue." class="content-image" /><img src="https://dzwpzdzxmxubgbpjkwlm.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/notion-images/push-hand/image-1755405904939-5.png" alt="The image features two abstract, humanoid figures seemingly engaged in dynamic movement against a minimalistic background with geometric shapes. One figure is red, while the other is black and white. They appear to be interacting with outlined cubes and pyramids in the background, creating a sense of motion and balance. The overall color palette is muted, and the design is modern and artistic." class="content-image" /></div><div class="column"><img src="https://dzwpzdzxmxubgbpjkwlm.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/notion-images/push-hand/image-1755405906600-6.png" alt="The image shows a serene park scene with a calm green lake. There are several small yellow boats with roofs, both on the water and near a dock. People are on the dock, enjoying the scene. The area is surrounded by lush green trees, with overcast skies above, giving a peaceful ambiance." class="content-image" /><p>We rebuilt Xiaogang Park where people practice pushing hands, put the participants' animation assets in the scene, and let them speak to their author about the experience in the workshop.</p><p>We also emphasized the dynamic process instead of a fixed outcome in making the short. We used the software interface as part of our visual element, to show the spirit of push hands--listening and following--is implemented not only between people but also between the animator and the software.</p></div></div><div class="video-wrapper"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X3yWJjqHwKM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen class="content-video"></iframe></div></div></main><script>function toggleTheme(){const currentTheme=document.documentElement.getAttribute('data-theme');const newTheme=currentTheme==='dark'?'light':'dark';document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-theme',newTheme);localStorage.setItem('theme',newTheme);}</script></body></html>
