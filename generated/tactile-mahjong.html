The second step involves a player with four bottles either winning or giving one out, and describing the bottle imaginatively. 

The third section allows other players to decide if they want to take the bottle based on the description. 

If no one takes it, another player repeats the process. Some drawings show people with bottles and imaginative descriptions with icons and symbols illustrating their thoughts.
